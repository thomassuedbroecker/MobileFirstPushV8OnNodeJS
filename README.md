# MobileFirstPushV8OnNodeJS

This project is a sample, how to integrate MFP Push REST API in a Node.js Server.
I build a Module you can use on you own risk.

To show all the dependencies I created a CF Node.js Application on Bluemix and as
MobileFirst Server I use the MobileFoundation Service on Bluemix.

To get more details on the Topic on MobileFirstFoundation Push Topic, please take a
look in the Offical documentation https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/ or other resources like mfp.help.

## Run the app locally

1. [Install Node.js][]
2. Download and extract the starter code from the Bluemix UI
3. cd into the app directory
4. Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the app
6. Access the running app in a browser at http://localhost:6001
